The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
// define a function that may throw an exception
void may_throw() {
    if (CONDITION) { // some condition that may be true
        throw ANY_EXCEPTION; // throw any type of exception
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        may_throw(); // call the function that may throw an exception
    } catch (...) { // catch any exception
        // handle the exception
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a `try-catch` block. Inside the `try` block, a function `may_throw` is called, which may throw an exception based on some condition. The `catch` block is designed to catch any type of exception. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
