The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
// define a function that will be used in a loop
int func(int x) {
    int result = x * 2; // result is related to x
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int arr[10]; // declare an array
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        arr[i] = func(i); // call the function in a loop
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a loop that calls a function `func`. The function `func` takes an integer argument and returns an integer result that is determined by the argument. The result of this function call is then used to assign values to the elements of an array `arr` within the loop. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.

The key characteristic here is that the function `func` is called within a loop in the `main` function, and the result of this function call is used to assign values to an array within the loop. This pattern is likely to trigger the `LICMPass` optimization pass in LLVM, which aims to sink loop-invariant computations out of the loop.
