The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
// define a function with a calling convention that can be changed
void __attribute__((noinline)) func() {
    // function body
}

int main() {
    // call the function
    func();
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a call to `func`. The function `func` is defined with a calling convention that can be changed, and it is not a variable argument function. The function `func` is not used by a trampoline intrinsic, so it is safe to remove the 'nest' attribute. The function `func` is not a varargs function, and is only called directly, so it can be promoted to use the Fast calling convention. The function `func` is not used by a trampoline intrinsic, so it is safe to remove the 'nest' attribute. The function `func` is not used by a trampoline intrinsic, so it is safe to remove the 'nest' attribute. The function `func` is not used by a trampoline intrinsic, so it is safe to remove the 'nest' attribute.
