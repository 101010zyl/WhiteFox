The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
float a = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable a
float b = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable b
bool condition = a > b; // a comparison between a and b

int main() {
    float result = condition ? a : b; // a select operation based on the comparison
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a select operation based on a comparison between two floating-point values `a` and `b`. The select operation chooses `a` if the condition `a > b` is true, otherwise it chooses `b`. The comparison operation and the select operation are the key parts of the code that can trigger the `InstCombineSelectPass` optimization. The comparison operation must be an unordered comparison (e.g., `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) between two floating-point values. The select operation must be based on the result of this comparison. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
