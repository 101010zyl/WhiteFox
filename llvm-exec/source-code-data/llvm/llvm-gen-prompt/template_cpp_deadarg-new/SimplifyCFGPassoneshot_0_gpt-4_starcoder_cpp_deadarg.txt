The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    if (CONDITION) { // any condition
        // This block is unreachable
        if (false) {
            // Do something here
            x = ANY_VALUE;
        }
    }
    return x;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a conditional statement, and within this conditional statement, there is another conditional statement that will never be executed (e.g., `if (false)`). The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
