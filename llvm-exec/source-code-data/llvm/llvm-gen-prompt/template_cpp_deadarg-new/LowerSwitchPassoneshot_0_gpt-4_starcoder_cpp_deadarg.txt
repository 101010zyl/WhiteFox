The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // x is a variable with any value
    switch (x) {
        case ANY_CASE_1: // ANY_CASE_1 is a constant value
            // Do something here
            break;
        case ANY_CASE_2: // ANY_CASE_2 is a constant value
            // Do something here
            break;
        // More cases can be added here
        default:
            // Do something here
            break;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a `switch` statement. The `switch` statement is based on a variable `x`, which can be any value. The `switch` statement contains multiple `case` branches, each of which is associated with a constant value (`ANY_CASE_1`, `ANY_CASE_2`, etc.). Each `case` branch contains some code to execute when the value of `x` matches the constant value of the `case`. There is also a `default` branch that contains some code to execute when the value of `x` does not match any of the `case` branches. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
