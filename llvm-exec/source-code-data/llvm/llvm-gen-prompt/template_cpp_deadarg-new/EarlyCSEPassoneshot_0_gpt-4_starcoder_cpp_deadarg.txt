The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    // Declare some variables
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // Declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // Declare variable y
    int z = ANY_VALUE; // Declare variable z

    // Perform some operations that can be simplified
    int a = x + 0; // a is equal to x
    int b = y * 1; // b is equal to y
    int c = z & z; // c is equal to z

    // Perform some operations that are identical to previous ones
    int d = x + 0; // d is equal to a
    int e = y * 1; // e is equal to b
    int f = z & z; // f is equal to c

    // Return a value that is related to the operations
    return a + b + c + d + e + f;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there are operations that can be simplified (e.g., adding zero, multiplying by one, bitwise AND with itself), and operations that are identical to previous ones. The `main` function must return a value that is related to these operations for further comparison. The optimization pass `EarlyCSEPass` can simplify these operations and eliminate the redundant ones, triggering the `Inst.replaceAllUsesWith(V);` line and making the boolean variable `Changed` equal to `True`.
