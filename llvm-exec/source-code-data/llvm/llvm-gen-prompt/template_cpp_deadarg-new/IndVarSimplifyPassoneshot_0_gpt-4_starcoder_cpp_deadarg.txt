The C++ code should contain the following pattern:
```cpp
int main() {
    int array[ANY_SIZE]; // declare an array with any size
    for (int i = 0; i < ANY_SIZE; ++i) { // a loop with a simple induction variable
        array[i] = ANY_EXPRESSION; // the array is modified inside the loop
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a loop with a simple induction variable `i`. The loop iterates over an array and modifies its elements. The loop must be in a simplified form, meaning it has a preheader and a single backedge. The induction variable `i` is used as an index to access and modify the array elements. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
