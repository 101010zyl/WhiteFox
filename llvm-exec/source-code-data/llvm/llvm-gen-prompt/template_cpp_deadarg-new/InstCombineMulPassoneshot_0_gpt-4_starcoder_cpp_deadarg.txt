The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    int result = x * (1 << y); // x is multiplied by a power of 2
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a multiplication operation where one operand is a variable and the other operand is a power of 2. The multiplication operation is performed and the result is returned. The power of 2 is represented as a shift-left operation (`1 << y`). The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
