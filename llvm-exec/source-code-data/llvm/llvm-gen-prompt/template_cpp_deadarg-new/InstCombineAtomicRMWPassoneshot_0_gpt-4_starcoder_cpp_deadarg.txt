The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<int> x;

int main() {
    int y = 0;
    x.fetch_add(y, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists an atomic operation on a global atomic variable `x`. The atomic operation is `fetch_add` which is an idempotent operation (an operation that produces the same result if performed multiple times). The operation is performed with a value `y` which is `0` and the memory order is `std::memory_order_relaxed`. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
