The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    int *p = new int; // allocate memory for an integer
    *p = x OPERATOR y; // assign the result of an operation on x and y to the memory pointed by p
    int result = *p; // retrieve the value from the memory pointed by p
    delete p; // deallocate the memory
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists an allocation of memory (`new int`), an assignment of a value to this memory (`*p = x OPERATOR y;`), and a retrieval of this value (`int result = *p;`). The `OPERATOR` can be any valid C++ operator, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc. The `ANY_VALUE` can be any valid C++ value. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
