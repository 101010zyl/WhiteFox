The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    // Declare multiple variables using alloca
    int* a = (int*) alloca(sizeof(int));
    int* b = (int*) alloca(sizeof(int));
    int* c = (int*) alloca(sizeof(int));
    // Use these variables in some operations
    *a = 10;
    *b = 20;
    *c = *a + *b;
    return *c;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there are multiple variables declared using `alloca` function. These variables are then used in some operations. The `main` function must return a value related to these operations for further comparison. 

The `alloca` function is used to allocate memory that is automatically freed when the function that called `alloca` returns. This is used to declare variables which are used in the function. The `alloca` function is used in the beginning of the function, before any other non-alloca instructions.
