The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    int a;
    float b;
};

int main() {
    MyStruct s;
    s.a = 10;
    s.b = 20.0f;
    int x = s.a;
    float y = s.b;
    // Do something with x and y, but don't use s anymore
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a structure is allocated and its fields are individually assigned to variables, but the structure itself is not used afterwards. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison. The structure `MyStruct` is defined with two fields of different types, `int` and `float`. In the `main` function, an instance of `MyStruct` is created and its fields are assigned to variables `x` and `y`. After these assignments, the structure `s` is not used anymore. The `SROAPass` optimization pass can then eliminate the dead instructions related to the unused structure `s`.
