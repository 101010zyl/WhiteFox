The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
typedef struct {
    int x;
    float y;
} MyStruct;

int main() {
    MyStruct s;
    s.x = 10;
    s.y = 20.5;
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a usage of a user-defined type (in this case, `MyStruct`). The `MyStruct` is a structure that contains two fields, `x` of type `int` and `y` of type `float`. The `main` function initializes an instance of `MyStruct`, assigns values to its fields, and then returns. The user-defined type name `MyStruct` is the symbol that can be stripped by the `StripSymbolsPass` optimization pass.
