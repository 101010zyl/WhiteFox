The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
float some_func(float x, float y) {
    float c1 = ANY_CONSTANT; // Declare a constant
    float result = (x + c1) * y; // Perform an operation that involves addition and multiplication
    return result;
}

int main() {
    float x = ANY_VALUE; // Declare a variable x
    float y = ANY_VALUE; // Declare a variable y
    float result = some_func(x, y); // Call the function some_func
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a call to `some_func`, and the result of this call is being used. `some_func` is a function that accepts two `float` arguments, then returns a single `float` value that is determined by the addition of the first argument and a constant, and the multiplication of the result with the second argument. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
