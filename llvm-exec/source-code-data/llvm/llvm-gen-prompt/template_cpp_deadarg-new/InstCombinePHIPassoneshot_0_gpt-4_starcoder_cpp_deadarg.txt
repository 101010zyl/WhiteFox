The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int cond = ANY_CONDITION; // any condition that can be evaluated to true or false
    int v = cond ? 1 : 2; // a select operation, v is a known non-zero value
    int p = v; // a phi node, p is equivalent to v
    if (p == 0) { // a comparison with zero
        // some code here
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a select operation that assigns a known non-zero value to a variable `v`. This variable `v` is then assigned to another variable `p`, which represents a phi node. The phi node `p` is only used in a comparison operation with zero. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
