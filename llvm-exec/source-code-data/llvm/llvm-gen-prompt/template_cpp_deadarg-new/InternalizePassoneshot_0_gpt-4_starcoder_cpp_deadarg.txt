The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
// define a global variable with an initializer
int global_var = 10;

// define a function that uses the global variable
void func() {
    global_var += 5;
}

int main() {
    func();
    return global_var;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a call to `func`, and the result of this call is being used. `func` is a function that modifies a global variable `global_var`. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.

The global variable `global_var` is initialized and used in a function `func` that is called in `main`. The global variable and the function are not marked as `static` or `extern`, and they are not used in any other translation units. This means that they are not part of the API of the module and can be internalized. The function `func` and the global variable `global_var` must not be declared in any comdat sections.
