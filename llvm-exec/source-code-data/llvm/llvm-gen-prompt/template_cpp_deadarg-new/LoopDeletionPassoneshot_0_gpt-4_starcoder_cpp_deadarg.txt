The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    while (CONDITION) { // CONDITION is a condition that can be evaluated to false at the first iteration
        RANDOM_CODE; // Do something here, but don't change the CONDITION
    }
    return x;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a `while` loop with a condition that can be evaluated to `false` at the first iteration. The loop body can contain any code, but it should not change the condition of the loop. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
