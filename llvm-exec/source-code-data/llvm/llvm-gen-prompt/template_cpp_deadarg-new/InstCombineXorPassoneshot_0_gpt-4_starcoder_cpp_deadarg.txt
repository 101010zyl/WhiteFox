The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    ANY_TYPE A = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable A
    ANY_TYPE B = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable B
    ANY_TYPE C = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable C
    // create a XOR operation between (A | B) and (A | C)
    ANY_TYPE result = (A | B) ^ (A | C);
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a XOR operation between two OR operations. The first OR operation is between variables `A` and `B`, and the second OR operation is between variables `A` and `C`. The result of this XOR operation is being used. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` can be any type, e.g. `int`, `float`, `ptr`, `struct`, and so on. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
