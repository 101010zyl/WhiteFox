The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    int shift_amount = ANY_VALUE; // declare shift_amount
    // Ensure shift_amount is less than the bit width of x and y
    // Ensure shift_amount is less than the difference between the bit width of x and y
    // Perform a left shift on x with no signed wrap (NSW) and then a right shift
    int result = (x << shift_amount) >> shift_amount;
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a left shift operation on a variable `x` with no signed wrap (NSW), followed by a right shift operation on the result. The shift amount for both operations is the same and is less than the bit width of `x` and `y` and less than the difference between the bit width of `x` and `y`. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
