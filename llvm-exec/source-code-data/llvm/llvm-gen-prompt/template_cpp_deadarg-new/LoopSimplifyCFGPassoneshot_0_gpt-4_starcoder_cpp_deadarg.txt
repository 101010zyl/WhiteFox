The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare y
    int z = ANY_VALUE; // declare z
    while (CONDITION) { // CONDITION is a constant expression that can be evaluated at compile time
        RANDOM_CODE; // Do something here with x, y, z
        if (ANOTHER_CONSTANT_CONDITION) { // ANOTHER_CONSTANT_CONDITION is a constant expression that can be evaluated at compile time
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a `while` loop with a constant condition that can be evaluated at compile time. Inside the loop, there is an `if` statement with a constant condition that can also be evaluated at compile time. The `while` loop must be a single latch loop, meaning it only has one exit point. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
