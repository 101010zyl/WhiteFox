The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
bool condition = ANY_BOOLEAN_VALUE; // a global boolean variable

void foo() {
    // some code here
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < ANY_POSITIVE_INTEGER; ++i) {
        if (condition) {
            foo();
        } else {
            // some other code here
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a loop with a condition that is invariant across the loop iterations. The condition is a global boolean variable that does not change within the loop. The loop contains an `if-else` statement that executes different code based on the condition. The function `foo` is called when the condition is true. The loop must have a positive integer as the loop count, and the `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
