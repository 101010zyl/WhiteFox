The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    int z = x + y; // perform some operation
    if (z == x + y) { // redundant comparison
        // some code
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a redundant comparison. The variables `x` and `y` are initialized with any value. Then, a new variable `z` is declared and assigned the result of an operation on `x` and `y`. Following this, there is an `if` statement that checks if `z` is equal to the operation on `x` and `y`. This comparison is redundant because `z` is already assigned the result of the operation on `x` and `y`, so the comparison will always be true. This redundancy can trigger the `InstSimplifyPass` optimization in LLVM, which simplifies the instructions and eliminates the redundant comparison, thus making the boolean variable `Changed` equal to `True`.
