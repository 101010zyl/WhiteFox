The C++ code should contain a function with variable arguments (denoted by "...") that is directly called in the `main` function. This function should be static, meaning it has local linkage, and it should not be a naked function (a function without a prologue or epilogue). The function should not contain any calls to `va_start` or any must-tail calls. 

Here is an example of such a code:

```cpp
// define a function with variable arguments
static int varargs_func(int x, ...) {
    // Do something here with input arguments, but don't use va_start or make must-tail calls
    int result = x + 1; // result is related to x
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // invoke the func varargs_func
    int result = varargs_func(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // you can pass any number of arguments of any type
    return result;
}
```

In this example, `varargs_func` is a function with variable arguments that is directly called in the `main` function. It is static, does not contain any calls to `va_start` or any must-tail calls, and is not a naked function. Therefore, this code can trigger the `DeadArgumentEliminationPass` optimization in LLVM, reaching the `F.replaceAllUsesWith(ConstantExpr::getBitCast(NF, F.getType()));` line and making the boolean variable `Changed` equal to `True`.
