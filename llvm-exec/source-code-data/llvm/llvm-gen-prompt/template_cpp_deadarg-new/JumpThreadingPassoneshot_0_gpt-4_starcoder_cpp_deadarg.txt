The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    if (CONDITION) { // CONDITION can be any condition that uses x and y
        // This block should be empty or only contain debug instructions
    } else {
        // This block should contain some operations
        // The operations can be any valid C++ operations
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists an `if` statement with an `else` branch. The `if` branch should be empty or only contain debug instructions, while the `else` branch should contain some operations. The condition of the `if` statement can be any condition that uses the variables `x` and `y`. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
