The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    ANY_TYPE x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    ANY_TYPE y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    // perform some operations on x and y
    ANY_TYPE result = x OPERATOR y; // result is related to x and y
    // truncate the result to a smaller type
    SMALLER_TYPE truncated_result = static_cast<SMALLER_TYPE>(result);
    return truncated_result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a computation involving variables `x` and `y` of any type (`ANY_TYPE`), and the result of this computation is being truncated to a smaller type (`SMALLER_TYPE`). The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison. 

The `OPERATOR` can be any binary operator, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, etc. The `ANY_TYPE` can be any type that supports the chosen operator, such as `int`, `float`, `double`, `long`, etc. The `SMALLER_TYPE` must be a type that is smaller than `ANY_TYPE`, such as `short` for `int`, `float` for `double`, etc. 

The `static_cast<SMALLER_TYPE>(result)` is the key part of the code that triggers the `InstCombineCastPass` optimization. This cast operation is translated into a `TruncInst` in LLVM IR, which is then optimized by the `InstCombineCastPass`.
