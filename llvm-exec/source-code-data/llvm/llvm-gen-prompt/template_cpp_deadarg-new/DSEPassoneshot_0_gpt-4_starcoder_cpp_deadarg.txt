The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int *p = new int; // allocate memory
    *p = 10; // store a value
    *p = 20; // overwrite the value
    delete p; // deallocate memory
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a memory location is written to more than once, with the earlier write(s) being dead stores because they are immediately overwritten by the later write(s) before the memory location is read from. The memory location is typically allocated dynamically using `new` or `malloc`, and deallocated using `delete` or `free`. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
